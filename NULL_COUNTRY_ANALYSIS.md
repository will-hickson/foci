# Null Country Data Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines data quality issues related to missing country information across different entity types in the PitchBook dataset. The analysis reveals significant data completeness challenges, particularly for individual persons.

## Key Findings

### Null Country Statistics by Entity Type

| Entity Type | Total Entities | Null Country Count | Null Percentage |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Investors** | 113 | 4 | 3.5% |
| **Service Providers** | 254 | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Limited Partners** | 211 | 0 | 0.0% |
| **Persons** | 61,740 | 20,831 | 33.7% |

### Data Quality Assessment

#### **High Quality Data**
- **Service Providers**: 100% complete country information
- **Limited Partners**: 100% complete country information
- **Investors**: 96.5% complete country information

#### **Data Quality Issues**
- **Persons**: 33.7% missing country information (20,831 out of 61,740)
- This represents a significant data completeness challenge for individual person analysis

### Impact on Analysis

#### **International Connections Analysis**
- **Investor Analysis**: Minimal impact (only 4 null values)
- **Service Provider Analysis**: No impact (complete data)
- **Limited Partner Analysis**: No impact (complete data)
- **Person Analysis**: Significant impact (20,831 missing country values)

#### **Company Summary Table**
The company summary table includes all available data, but the following limitations apply:
- International person counts may be understated due to missing country data
- 33.7% of persons cannot be classified as international or domestic
- This affects the accuracy of international board member counts

### Recommendations

#### **For Data Quality Improvement**
1. **Person Data Enhancement**: Prioritize country data collection for the 20,831 persons with missing country information
2. **Data Validation**: Implement validation rules to prevent future null country entries
3. **Data Source Review**: Investigate why person data has significantly lower completeness than organizational data

#### **For Analysis Accuracy**
1. **Transparency**: Always report null country counts alongside international statistics
2. **Conservative Estimates**: Use conservative estimates for international person counts
3. **Data Quality Flags**: Include data quality indicators in analysis outputs

### Technical Implementation

#### **Null Detection Method**
- Used `pandas.isna()` to detect actual null values
- Confirmed no empty strings (`""`) in country fields
- All null values are true nulls, not empty strings

#### **Analysis Scripts Updated**
- ✅ `company_summary_table.py`: Includes null count reporting
- ✅ `company_analysis_plots.py`: Includes null count information in plot outputs
- ✅ `enhanced_international_analysis.py`: Tracks null country entities

### Generated Outputs

#### **CSV Files with Null Information**
- ✅ `null_country_entities_summary.csv`: Summary of null country counts by entity type
- ✅ `company_summary_table.csv`: Company-level metrics (affected by null data)

#### **Analysis Scripts**
- ✅ All scripts now report null country statistics
- ✅ Plot outputs include null count information
- ✅ Summary statistics include data quality metrics

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals a significant data quality issue with person country information, where 33.7% of persons lack country data. This impacts the accuracy of international connection analysis, particularly for person-related metrics. Organizational data (investors, service providers, limited partners) maintains high data quality with minimal null values.

**Key Takeaway**: While organizational international connections can be analyzed with high confidence, person-based international connections should be interpreted with caution due to the significant missing country data.
